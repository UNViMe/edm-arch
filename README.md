# About this work
Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a discipline concerned with developing methods for exploring the specific and large amounts of data from educational environments and using those methods to better understand students and the institutions in which they learn. Following the lines of research promoted by the *International Organizations in Education* (UNESCO, IESALC), the European Commission in AI, and considering the scarcity of data scientists in ML, **a new EDM model is proposed for educational problems that can be executed without data scientists or with a minimal presence of data scientists**. For this purpose, state-of-the-art techniques and tools such as Data Preprocessing, Feature Preprocessing, AutoML, and IML are articulated.

## Proposed Model

The proposed model will allow educational institutions to obtain complex knowledge by applying Machine Learning with a minimal presence of data scientists or with human resources that have only some of the skills that a data scientist would possess.

## Web tool
To facilitate the process of using the proposed model, it is accompanied by a tool that provides web-based access to people with minimal training. The proposed tool, which is currently under active development can be used in preview, was designed and evaluated in the context of an Argentine public university. 

![Web Tool Architecture](https://github.com/UNViMe/edm-arch/raw/main/ToolArchitecture.svg)

The tool is composed of 3 applications that are integrated in a traditional 3-tier web architecture. The source code can be found in three private repositories available to selected users:
- End User Web Interface (https://github.com/waltermolina/edm-react-app)
- Business Logic Rest API (https://github.com/waltermolina/edm-rest-api)
- EDM Core API (https://github.com/waltermolina/edm-py-api)
